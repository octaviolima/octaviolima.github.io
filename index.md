# Octavio E Lima

## About Me

I got my B.S. in Economics (with an IT Minor) from the University of Oregon. Currently, I'm working as a Research Analyst at The Wharton School, in the areas of Household Finance and Urban Economics. 

My past internships at MIT and Princeton have further inspired me to pursue a career in the fields of Causal Inference and Machine Learning. Eventually, I plan to enroll in graduate school and pursue applied research on these topics.
